#Assignment Operators

x = 5  # Assigning value 5 to x

x += 3  # Same as x = x + 3 → x becomes 8
print(x)

x -= 2  # Same as x = x - 2 → x becomes 6
print(x)

x *= 2  # Same as x = x * 2 → x becomes 12
print(x)

x /= 3  # Same as x = x / 3 → x becomes 4.0
print(x)

x //= 2  # Floor division assignment
print(x)  # 4.0 // 2 = 2.0

x %= 2  # Modulus assignment
print(x)  # 2.0 % 2 = 0.0

x **= 3  # Exponentiation assignment
print(x)  # 0^3 = 0
